# To Do

 - ### Prefabs
   - Add ability to create/edit prefabs
   - Create new game objects from prefabs
   - Serialize objects from prefabs (only serialize unique parameters)
   - Add api for loading objects from prefabs
   - Data structure in game for holding loaded prefab copies (instantiation of prefabs will just copy this entity)

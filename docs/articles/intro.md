# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation page for the Chroma Engine.

While the engine is still in its early stages of development, I felt it was pertinent to provide some baseline information on how the engine works and how to use it. Hopefully the provided material here will help someone wishing to give it a try the tools to create something.

This is not a tutorial on game development or programming, this is only designed to get one familiar with the tools provided by the engine, and reference material for the scripting language.

These documents are subject to constant change, as the state of the engine is currently in flux. The engine is subject to breaking changes to its tools, API, and systems. So *use at your own risk*.
